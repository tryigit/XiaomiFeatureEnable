> [!WARNING]
> Most features in this module require hardware support to work! Therefore, Qualcomm or another company must have added this feature to your Vendor file.

> [!TIP]
> Some features require cloud control, Like Joyose app feature. So maybe some modules like HyperCeiler could work. It will be tested and added in the future.
